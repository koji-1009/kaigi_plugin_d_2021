# About

A sample repository for [FlutterKaigi 2021](https://flutterkaigi.jp/#/).

This is one of the packages that will be included in [project_2021](https://github.com/koji-1009/kaigi_project_2021).
This is a reference code to explain the management of Flutter's private plugins and packages, and the microservice of the UI.

# Description

This Flutter Package is supposed to be loaded into [plugin_b](https://github.com/koji-1009/kaigi_plugin_b_2021).
Therefore, when the application is released to the market, it will be loaded into [project_2021](https://github.com/koji-1009/kaigi_project_2021) via [plugin_b](https://github.com/koji-1009/kaigi_plugin_b_2021).

To check the operation of plugin_d alone, a Flutter application is prepared in the example directory. This sample application relies on [plugin_a](https://github.com/koji-1009/kaigi_plugin_a_2021) to get the theme.
